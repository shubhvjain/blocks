This program takes in annotated document (a collection of blocks) , processes all annotations and generates "Document Object", which contains 4 main objects (along with other useful objects about the doc) : 
- "blockContent" object which  contains the final values of all  the blocks 
- "blockDependencyGraph :  a directed acyclic graph which shows the relationships among the blocks 
- "blockProcessingOrder" :  topological order in which the blocks must be processed to ensure that for all blocks, their dependencies are processed before it
- "knowledgeGraph" : graph that stores user defined relations between blocks, which are defined in the document using action annotations 

Here is the main program that does that : 

.[Main]
  >[Imports]
  >[Global Declerations]
  >[Utility Functions]
  >[Annotation Declerations]
  >[Generate document object]
  >[Generate output document]

What will this "Main" program generate ?
A Javascript module that returns 2 main functionalities : "generateDocObject" and "generateOutputDoc".
However, I still need to test all other methods. So I will create 2 different files for the program : one is the actual program file that exports just the 2 main functions. Another file where all the functionalities are exported to thoroughly test all parts of the program.

Here's the main program file :

.[Main Program]
  >[Main]
  module.exports = { generateDocObject, generateOutputDoc }

And here's the test program file:

.[Program for testing]
  >[Main]
  module.exports = { docToBlocks, getBlankDocObj, getBlankDepGraph, hashBlockId, annotations, generateProcessingOrder, processBlocksInOrder, generateDocObject, generateOutputDoc }

Moving on to the parts of the program :

The program depends on the Graph library I created as a separate project. See github.com/shubhvjain/graphs. I am assuming the latest version of the graph program is available with the name "graph.js" in the same folder which is imported here:

.[Imports]
const graph = require('./graph')

We require several utility functions.

.[Doc conventions]
- whenever i declare a block for a standalone method, i use the following naming conventions for that block : Method to <function description> . (e.g. Method to split doc)

.[Utility functions]
  >[Method to split doc into blocks]
  >[Method to generate random integer]  
  >[method to print an object]
  >[method to generate blank block content object]
  >[method to generate blank block dependency graph]
  >[method to generate blank knowledge graph]
  >[method to hash block name]

Blocks are the smallest units of processing. So we must extract all blocks from a document. 
This method takes in a doc and a splitter and returns an array of blocks by splitting the doc string using the provided splitter.
By convention, blocks are seperated by a new line. 
So let's create a new global decleration for that

.[+Doc conventions]
- global decleration/variables names are in camel case and begins with upper case

.[global declerations]
const BlockSplitCharacter = "\n"

.[Method to split Doc into blocks]
const docToBlocks = (doc,splitter)=>{ return doc.split(splitter)}

.[Method to generate random integer]
const randomInteger = (min=0,max=100) => { return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min)}

This method is useful to assign random names to blocks which are not named in the document.  

.[method to print an object]
const print = (obj,indent=1)=>{console.log(JSON.stringify(obj,null,indent))} 

this utility function prints out an object. for debugging purpose

.[method to generate blank block content object]
const getBlankDocObj = ()=>{ return { blocks:[], data:{}}}

.[method to generate blank block dependency graph]
const getBlankDepGraph = ()=>{
  let newG = graph.createGraph({ title:"Block Dependency graph", hasLoops: false, hasDirectedEdges: true,  isSimple: true })
  return {...newG}
}

.[method to generate blank knowledge graph]
const getBlankKnowledgeGraph = ()=>{
  let newG = graph.createGraph({ title:"Doc knowledge graph", hasLoops: false, hasDirectedEdges: true,  isSimple: true })
  return {...newG}
}

.[method to hash block name]
const hashBlockId = (text)=>{
  let txt = text.trim()
  let isAppend = false
  if(txt[0]=='+'){
    txt = txt.substring(1)
    isAppend = true
  }
  txt = txt.replaceAll(/ +/g,'-')
  txt = txt.toLowerCase()
  return { isAppend: isAppend, id: txt }
}

The above can be understood more easily with some examples:
- hash("block name") = "block-name"
- hash("Block Name") = "block-name"
- hash("BLOCK name") = "block-name"
- hash("  BLOCK   name   ") = "block-name"
(all the above produces the same output)
- hash("+block name") = "block-name"

Now, the most important part of the programs. The annotation declarations. 

What are annotations ? Specifying annotations in the document is a way to include metadata related to the document content. Annotations makes the document more structured and provides a way to extract "knowledge" from the document which can be further processed.  

There are 3 types of annotations :
- declaration : this will be used to declare blocks or give names to blocks
- invocation : this will be used to include the content of one blocks in another block (or to declare a block dependency)
- action : to declare metadata and actions. these annotations are processed within a "context" which is determined by the locations of where it is used

Each annotation type has a different delimiter within which they are "defined" in a document

For each type of annotation, we need to specify a few things :
- how to extract annotations from the block text ?
- how generate a replacement text for a certain annotation ? (after an annotation is successfully processed, it can either be removed from the processed block text or replaced with some text or left unchanged)
- how to initiate further processing of extracted annotations?


Here is the main object where all annotations are defined :

.[Annotation declerations]
const annotations = {
  >[decleration annotation],
  >[invocation annotation],
  >[action annotation]
}

.[decleration annotation]
declaration: {
  extract:(text)=>{
      // all declarations are in the first annotation block.
      const tx = text.trim()
      const theRegex = /^\.\[([\+]?)([\w\s\-]+?)\]/gm
      const parts = tx.match(theRegex)
      let rawSource = `.[${randomInteger(10000,99999)}]`
      if(parts){rawSource = parts[0]}
      let processedSource = rawSource.replaceAll(".[","")
      processedSource = processedSource.replaceAll("]","")
      const blockName = hashBlockId(processedSource)
      return { rawSource, ...blockName}
    },
    generateText: (text)=>{
      const theRegex = /^\.\[([\+]?)([\w\s\-]+?)\]/gm
      return text.replaceAll(theRegex,"")
    }
}

.[invocation annotation]
invocation: {
    extract: (text) =>{
      const txt = text.trim()
      const theRegex = /\>\[([\w\s\-]+?)\]/gm
      const parts = txt.match(theRegex)
      let asmts = []
      if(parts){
        parts.map(part=>{
          let t = part.replaceAll(">[","")
          t = t.replaceAll("]","")
          asmts.push({ rawSource: part, blockId: hashBlockId(t)['id']})
        })
      }
      return asmts
    }
}

.[action annotation]
action: {
  extract: (text) => {
  }
}

action annotations allows one to do a lot of things. 

How to specify them : withing the "/[]" delimiter. one action per bracket. to define multiple actions, use multiple brackets
Each action has a format : "action-name : arguments". E.g. /[todo: do nothing.just a demo]

here is a list of things that can be done using action annotations :
- defining documents related actions. when working actively on a document , you would want to add actions that you can take later. for instance editing a block later. 
- relating the current block to some other block in the knowledge graph 
- specify data type of a block
- load another file in the document 
- query and display part of knowledge graph
- specify block format (e.g heading, section title etc...)

A note on how to specify action annotations:
Here are a few ways in which we can call a function in js:
- fn(arg1,arg2) : positional arguments ; have to remember the position of each argument
- fn(arg1=value1,arg2=value2) : arguments have names , their position can be changes ; more flexibilty
- fn({arg1:val,arg2:val}): similar to last one. now the function has a single argumnet which is an object ; position also does not matter
(in the last 2 we need to remember the names of arguments, which is better than remembering their position as in the first case)

The question is how to specify actions arguments ?
The format of specifying the action itself is fixed i.e. "action-name : arguments"
In most cases there will be a single argument. like : "todo:this"
But multiple arguments will be required. like when specifying the data type of a block as a resource, we need to specify the location of the resource as well. 


Now we need to the actual generation of the document object. 
The first step is to actually generating the blocks by  splitting the document. 
we must also initialise:
- the document object. this consists of :
  - an array of "blocks" which holds the blocks in the order in which they were declared in the document
  - a blank object "data". data will contain all processed block data. the key will be  unique block in the document and it value will be all the data related to that block. this may include the raw text, processed text, annotations used in the text etc...
- the block dependency graph. blocks once declared (via deceleration annotation) can be used in other blocks. this means some blocks will depend on other blocks for their full content. this means we have to make sure that there are no cyclic dependencies among the blocks and a block is processed after all it's dependent blocks are processed. this is ensured if the block dependency graph forms a directed acyclic graph. the block dependency graph captures the dependencies of one block over other. 

consider the following example :
block1 : some text
block2 : some text + block 1
here block2 is dependent on block1. in the dependency graph there will be a directed edge from block2 to block1 because block 2 depends on block1 for its content. thus block 1 must be processed first. 

now consider 
block1 : some text + block 2
block 2: some text + block 3
block 3 : some text + block 1
the above blocks cannot be processed as there is a cyclic dependency between them. 

once we have an array of blocks, we need to iterate through all the blocks to do a few things :
- one : process decleration annotations
  - determine the name of each blocks. 
  - some blocks might be named using the declaration annotation. if not, they have to be assigned a unique block name.
  - if block is being processed for the first time, we need to initialize the block in the blockContent object as well. 
  - if the block is being appended, some additional processing needs to be done 

- two : process block data. by default blocks are simple text. adding structure to document also means to be able to specify data in difftent formats with ease. the 2 most commonly used data structures are : dictionary and tables

- three : process invocation annotation and build the dependency graph along the way. the final processing of blocks will take place only after the complete depnencey graph is checked for cycle. this means we would need another iteration over the blocks to finally process them. thus there will be 2 passes over the block: the first pass (which is currenlty being described here) and the second pass that take places only after dependenies are checked.

  >[Method to process block data type]
  >[Method to generate block processing order]
  const generateDocObject = (doc,options={})=>{
    try{
      const blocks = docToBlocks(doc,"\n\n")
      let obj = firstPass(blocks)
      let blockContent = obj.d
      let blockDepGraph = obj.g
      let order =  generateProcessingOrder(blockDepGraph)
      blockContent = processBlocksInOrder(blockContent,order.vertexInOrder)
      return {blockContent, blockDependencyGraph, ...order }
    }catch(error){console.log(error)}
  } 

.[Method for First pass]
const firstPass = (blocks) => {
  >[initialize doc and graph]
  blocks.map((block,index)=>{
    if(block){
        >[process decleration annotations in the block]
        >[process assignment annotations in the block]
    }
  })
  edgesToAdd.map(edge=>{g = graph.addEdge(g,edge)})
  return {d,g}
}

.[initialize doc and graph]
  let d = getBlankDocObj()
  let g = getBlankDepGraph()
  let kg = getBlankKnowledgeGraph()
  let edgesToAdd = []

.[process decleration annotations in the block]
const newBlock = annotations.declaration.extract(block)
const processedText = annotations.declaration.generateText(block)
if(d.blocks.indexOf(newBlock.id)==-1){
  d.blocks.push(newBlock.id)
  let data = {
    rawText: [{block,index}],
    text:processedText,
    annotations: { d:{index, ...newBlock}, a:{}}
  }
  d.data[newBlock.id] = data
  g = graph.addVertex(g,{id:newBlock.id})
}else{
  if(newBlock.isAppend){
    d.data[newBlock.id]['text'] += processedText
    d.data[newBlock.id]['rawText'].push({block,index})
  }
}

.[process assignment annotations in the block]
const allAsmts = annotations.assignment.extract(block)
if(!d.data[newBlock.id]['annotations']['a']['valid']){
  d.data[newBlock.id]['annotations']['a']['valid'] = []
}
allAsmts.map(itm=>{
  if(itm.id != newBlock.id){
    d.data[newBlock.id]['annotations']['a']['valid'].push({index,...itm})
    edgesToAdd.push({v2:itm.blockId, v1:newBlock.id })
  }
})

.[Method for Second pass]
const processBlocksInOrder = (docObj, vertexOrder) => {
  vertexOrder.map(v=>{
    let validAnn = docObj['data'][v.vertexId]['annotations']['a']['valid']
    if(validAnn.length > 0){
      let mainText = docObj['data'][v.vertexId]['text']
      validAnn.map(annBlock=>{
        let annText = docObj['data'][annBlock.blockId]['text']
        mainText = mainText.replaceAll(`${annBlock.rawSource}`,annText)
      }) 
      docObj['data'][v.vertexId]['text'] = mainText
    }
  })
  return docObj
}

.[Method to generate block processing order]
const generateProcessingOrder = (blockDep)=>{ return graph.TopologicalSort(blockDep) }


.[Method to process block data type]
const dataType = {
  "key-value":(blocktext)=>{},
  "table":(blockText) => {},
  "list":(blockText)=>{},
  "resource":(blockText)=>{},
  "code":(blockText)=>{},
}

Processing data types : 

Key value store :
.[key value store example] /[type:key-value] This is the title of the key value store
- key1 : value of key 1
- key2: value of key2

List :
.[list example] /[type:list] this is similar to key value pair
- item 1 
- item 2
- item 3
- at this point i will just have the single level of list 

Table:
.[table example] /[type:table , cols:"col1,col2,col3" , spliter : ;]
- row1-col1; row1-col2 ; row1-col3
- row2-col1; row2-col2 ; row2-col3

Resource: a block can also be an external resource 
.[external resource] /[type:res loc="path/to/file"]

its usage: now we can access specific parts of a block in invocation annotations. For examples:
- here is the value of the key named key1 in the block name "key value pair example" : >[key value pair example.key1]
- here is value of 1st item in the list "list example" : >[list example.1]
- here is the value from the 1st row and col1 from "table example" : >[table example.1.col1]

resources can be used in many ways. the 3 most common types of resources will be : images, PDF documents, text files  
- if it's a pdf file , one can refer to individual pages of the doc
- if it's an image, one can refer to specific parts of the image

Phew! the main part of the program is done! Now, given a document, we can generate a document Object for it which consists of blockContent, blockDependencyGraph, blockProcessingOrder and knowlegeGraph 
Now we can foucs on generating outputs from this doucment. By utilizing all the objects generated for this document we can generate all sorts of documents. for instance we can save content of a certian block as a file. this block can be a fully functional program.
We can also generate interactive HTML documents. 

.[Generate output document]
const generateOutputDoc = async (doc,options={ type:"file-with-entry"})=>{
  if(!options.type){throw new Error("No doc type specified")}
  const docTypes = {
    "file-with-entry": async ()=>{
      if(!options.main){throw new Error("Specify the main block Id which contains the code")}
      const Document = generateDocObject(doc,options) 
      return Document['docObject']['data'][options.main]['text']
    },
