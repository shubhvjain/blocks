.[block 1] this is the first block in the doc
  
.[block 2] this is the second block
  
.[b1] this the block number 1, which has some content here.
  
.[b2] this is the 2nd block. 
  
now i feel like appending more to the first block. I can go on the top of the doc and do it but that would not indicate how my doc evolved with my explrations. 
  
so here you go ....
  
.[+b1] this is some more content that will be appended to block with id "b1"
  
.[main content]
  >[part1]
  >[part2]
  
notice that we have not yet defined part1 or part2. Let's do that now 
  
.[part1] this is part one of my content
  
.[part2] this is a more complex block. Not only this contains text of it's own, it also has appliction annotations for other block.
